[Main README.md file](README.md)

## Development
During the development of this project, I had the experience of facing some problems. Browser used for testing application during development was **[Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)** and **[Dev Tools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools)** from same browser. For audit the site i have used **[Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/)** from **Chrome DevTools**. Exhaustively testing the functionality of each part of the application and managed to solve most of the problems that i have came across before writing this document. However how process of testing is being expanding on different browsers and different devices some problems are found and noticed. Some of them I have solved and corrected, some remained uncorrected until the end of the test.

I received help from some family members and friends to do the tests on application.

Testing is conduct by sharing application to them and have conversation about application.

This was the primary method of testing the application. People were asked to visit the website on a variety of devices. This feedback was very uselful to determine any bugs that may have been present. I also tested the app manually myself on a varietly of browsers and tools.
